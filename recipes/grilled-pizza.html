<p> <h3>Amazing pizza made on <em>the grill!</em></h3></p>
        <p> Prepare dough, add toppings, cook on the grill and <em>Voila!</em></p>
        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 envelope pizza crust yeast (such as Fleischmann's)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups warm water (120 to 130 degrees F/49 to 54 degrees C)</li>
            <li>⅓ cup oil, and more as needed</li>
            <li>½ cup pizza sauce, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl; stir in warm water and ⅓ cup oil until well combined, about 1 minute. Gradually add enough flour to form a slightly sticky dough ball. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface; knead until dough is smooth, elastic, and not sticky, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 8 equal portions; pat or roll dough portions on a floured work surface to about 8-inch circles (they don't need to be perfect).</li>
            <li>Brush both sides dough circles with oil; place on the grill. Cook on the preheated grill until bottoms are lightly browned and tops look set, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer crusts to a baking sheet, grilled-sides up, using long-handled tongs.</li>
            <li>Lightly coat each crust with sauce; top with cheese.</li>
            <li>Slide pizzas back on the grill; cook until bottom crusts are brown and cheese melts, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
